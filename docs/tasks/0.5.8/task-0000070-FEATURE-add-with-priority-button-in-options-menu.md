# TASK: FEATURE: Add an option button to mark pisode with priority in episode card (grid and list view) 

## Overview

Add an option button in the episodes card (grid and list view) to allow the user toggle to mark the episode with "priority" (yes/no). This will allow the user to prioritize episodes in the watchlist. 

We already have a filter for priority, but no way of telling the app which episodes are a priority. 


## Requirements

- The button should toggle the priority of the episode (yes/no). 
- It should also be added in the episode details page. 
- Place the option button below "Add/remove favorite" option menu.
- Use a diamond icon (filled or outlined depending on the state).
