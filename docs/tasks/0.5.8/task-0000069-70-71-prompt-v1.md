- @task-0000071-FEATURE-refactor-ui-floating-filters.md

## V2

A few things to fix:

### Issue 1
- [ ] The floating bar has a UI that is not functional on screens from 1024px to 1280px horizontal resolution. The search textfield has too little space.  We should use the same approach that we use on screens with less than 1024px horizontal resolution, that is, have the textfield take the full width of the screen and have the filters below it.

### Issue 2 
- [ ] The filter by tag button should show the "clear all" button. And the "clear all" button should be hidden when the user has not selected any tags. When clicked, the clear all button should reset the filters to the default state as now, but it should also reset the filter by tag which is currently not reset.

### Issue 3
- [ ] The user can click the search buton in the navigation in order to hide the floating bar. In case there is any active filters and the search and filter pannel is hiden , we should set the icon of the search button with a different color to denote that are filters active. 

### Issue 4
- [ ] A few things to chage related to the priority filter
1. priority filter does not filter the episodes. It toggles but it does not filter the episodes with priority.
2. The icon used for priority is not the same one we use in the fitler with jewelbest one. Let's use a star icon instead.
3. When an episode is marked as priority, it shows a rounded pill with the text "High" in the episode card and list row. It should show the same jewel icon we use in the filter and in the option menu.

### Issue 5
- [ ] Let's remove the title and subtitle from the top of each page, and add just the title to the navigation bar right after the logo icon:
    - Watchlist: 
        - REMOVE: We should remove "Watch Later" and "Manage your videos and podcasts to watch later"
        - ADD in navigation bar: "Watch Later"
        - MAINTAIN: list/grid view toggle button on the top right of the page and episodes being shown from total, eg: "Showing 100 of 208 episodes"
    - Channel: 
        - REMOVE: We should remove "Channels & Podcasts" and "All sources from your saved content"
        - ADD in navigation bar: "Channels"
        - MAINTAIN: list/grid view toggle button on the top right of the page 
    - Stats: 
        - REMOVE: We should remove "Usage Statistics" and "Detailed insights into your watch history and library."
        - ADD in navigation bar: "Stats"
    - Settings: 
        - REMOVE: We should remove "Settings"
        - ADD in navigation bar: "Settings"

## V3

### Issue 6
- [ ] As you can see in the image, in the case of the third video, the one on the right is marked as favorite and has notes. Both icons represnting each concept overlap. In this case, place them one next to the other. Priority should go first if exists, then fav and then notes.

## V4

### Issue 7
- [ ] The floating panel should have blured background with transparency. Also, lets cut the bottom padding of the floating panel to make it look more compact. 

## V5

### Issue 8
- [ ] If we have a filter applied, the search button now shows a red color accent to denote that are filters active. However, when i hover over to the search button, to close the floating panel, it shows the default color (white), which is confussing. It should show another tone of red to denote that it is active and hover over at the same time.
