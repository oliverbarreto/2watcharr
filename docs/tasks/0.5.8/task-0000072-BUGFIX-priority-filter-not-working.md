# TASK - BUGFIX: Priority filter not working

The priority filter is not working as expected. When the user clicks on the priority button, the filter is not applied to the episodes. The button quickly flashes to the active state but then it is quickly disabled and the episodes are not filtered. We still get the url with http://localhost:3000/. It should behave just like the favorite filter, but for priority.
