# Task: Modifications to task-0000036-timeline-dates-sections-in-watchlist-page-prompt-v4.md

A minor Fix, The filters now work much better with only one thing we need to fix.

when we click on the checkbox for priority or favorite shows correctly the episodes that have priority or favorite, but when we click again to deselect the checkbox the list shows the ones with those atributes set to false, when the expected behavior is to show all the episodes.

Selected checkbox should only show the episodes with that attribute set to true, and when the checkbox is not selected should show all the episodes.
