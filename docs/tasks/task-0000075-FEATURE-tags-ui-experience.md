TASK: FEATURE: Tags UI Experience

We want to improve the UI experience of the tags on the settings page and also on the way we allow the user to add tags and filter episodes with tags modals.

## PREFERENCES PAGE GOALS
- In the tags tab in preferences, we want to alphabetically order the tags in the list of existing tags.

## TAGS FILTER GOALS
- In the modal to add a tag and in the list of tag pills we show on the tag filter, we want to order tags having the most used tags first on the list.

## ADD TAGS MODAL GOALS
- The modal shows a list of "Recent tags" but I don't fully understand the logic behind it. It seems to be ordered by the last time the tag was used, but I am not sure. 

We must make sure we are ordering all tags by the last time they were used. This should be thoroughly analyzed, it could become a potential performance issue.

## REQUIREMENTS:
- We do not want to change any other existing functionality, just improve the UI experience.
- We must make sure we do not break any other existing functionality.
