# Task: Improve Channel Card on Mobile

In mobile devices, we do not have the way to show the overlay that displays the channel information. Also the current height of the overlay does not fit well the information. As you can see in the image below, the row with the information of type of channel (youtube/podcast) and the number of episodes is cut off and we cannot see the whole information. It looks odd. In order to make it fit, we need to give a bit more height to the overlay.

Aslo, in order to allow in mobile devices be able to show the overlay, we must add a button with a chveron icon to the card. This button will be visible only in mobile devices. When clicked, it will expand the card to show the overlay information. When clicked again, it will collapse the card to hide the overlay information. 

Keep the cool and nice looking existing animations. Do not change anything else.
