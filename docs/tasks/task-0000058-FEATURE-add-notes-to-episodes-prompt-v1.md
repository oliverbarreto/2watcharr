## Overview

We want to allow the user to add notes to an episode. As an example, I could want to add that this episode covers a specific topic or theme, or a note to reflect that the user liked the diagram or methodology, liked the characters, etc. 

## Requirements

- Add a new column to the database to store the notes.
- It should be retro compatible with the current database.
- Add a new button to the episode card to open a modal to add/edit the notes associated with the episode.
- The notes could have a maximum length of 255 characters.
