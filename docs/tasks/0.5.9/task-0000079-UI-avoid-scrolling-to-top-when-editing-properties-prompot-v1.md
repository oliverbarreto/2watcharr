TASK: FEATURE: Avoid scrolling to top when editing properties


## Overview

When editing the properties of a episode in the watchlist page, if I set any property like eg: liked or priority for an episode, the page scrolls to the top after the properties are saved. 

This is not a good user experience. The page should not scroll to the top when the properties are saved. The app should show where the user was right before the properties were saved, show the episode card or row that he was interacting with.

Is it possible to address this issue ?
