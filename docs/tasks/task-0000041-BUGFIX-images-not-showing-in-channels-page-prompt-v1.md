# BUGFIX: Images not showing in channels page

As you can see in the image, the images of the channels' thumbnails are not showing in the channels page. They were there a minute ago, but now they are not showing.

I am trying to fix it by using the "sync metadata" button, but it doesn't work.

Then suddently a few minutes later, the images are showing again. It is very strange.

I do not know the reason, but it could be due to using links to the images instead of the actual images saved locally ?

Investigate this issue and try to find a solution. Should we design a way to download locally the thumbnail image of a channel ???

Do not implement any code yet. Just explore the codebase, analyze the problem and try to find a solution.
