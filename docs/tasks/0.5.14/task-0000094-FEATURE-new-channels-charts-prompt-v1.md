## Overview

We want to create a way to visualize some channels stats. We want to visualize videos added/watched by channel: i think the best way to achieve this graphically is to create a chart like the one we already have for Videos per Tag, where we have the tags below and we allow selecting individual tags to show on the chart, and offer options for selecting and deselecting all, but for episodes by channel. 

We then can have a radio buttons group where we can toggle to show added vs watched episodes, and favorited/with priority/liked/disliked by channel.
