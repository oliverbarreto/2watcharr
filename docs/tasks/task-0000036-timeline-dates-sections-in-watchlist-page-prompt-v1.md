# Task: Timeline Dates Sections in Watch List Page

## Description

We want to divide the watch list page into dates sections similar to what YouTube history page does to make the Watch List page more user-friendly by having a sense of time, when were the episodes added orwatched.

As you can see in the image, Youtube history page shows the history videos watched by the user grouped by dates, in order of the most recent date to the oldest date.

Our list is already order with the most recent date at the top and the oldest date at the bottom.

We also provide a number of ways to sort the list. All of these options are available in the watch list page.

- manual
- Date Added
- Date Watched
- Date Favorited
- Date Removed
- Priority
- Favorite
- Duration
- Title

All options related with dates should be divided into sections with the date as the section title, grouping all episodes added/watched/favorited/removed on that date. according to the selected sort option in that moment.

Other options like sorted by priority, favorite, duration, title, etc. should be applied to the whole list. For instance, in the case of sorting by priority, the list should show the episodes with the highest priority first, no matter the date, but divided into sections with the date as the section title. The same for favorite, duration, title, etc.

## Goal

I want to investigate first if this way of filtering and presenting the information on the watch list page is going to represent a performance issue.

IMPORTANT: I DO NOT WANT TO IMPLEMENT THIS FEATURE YET. We also want this feature in a way that it is easy to maintain and update in the future.

## Acceptance Criteria

Thoroughly analyze the watch list page for both desktop and mobile versions to analyze the impact of this feature on performance and if fesible, come up with a detailed implementation plan to ensure that the timeline dates sections can be implemented correctly.
