# Task: Add settings option for default filter 

We need to add a settings option to allow the user to select a default filter for the watchlist page among the different options available (Manual, Date added/watched/favorited/removed). 

Currently it is "manual" filtering. The default option should be "Date Added".

This filter will be applied when the user opens the watchlist page and will be saved in the user's preferences. 

Add this option in the general tab of the settings page.
