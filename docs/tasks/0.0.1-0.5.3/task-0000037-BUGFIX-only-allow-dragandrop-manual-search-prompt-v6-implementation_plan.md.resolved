# Remove Drag Handles for Non-Manual Filters

Improve the watch list UI by removing reorder handles and disabling dragging when the sort order is not "Manual" (custom).

## Proposed Changes

### Episode Components

#### [MODIFY] [episode-card.tsx](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/episode-card.tsx)
- Add `isDraggable?: boolean` to [EpisodeCardProps](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/episode-card.tsx#49-54).
- Pass `disabled: !isDraggable` to `useSortable`.
- Conditionally render the top drag handle based on `isDraggable`.
- Remove `cursor-grab` classes from the bottom red area and only spread `attributes`/`listeners` if `isDraggable` is true.

#### [MODIFY] [episode-list-row.tsx](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/episode-list-row.tsx)
- Add `isDraggable?: boolean` to [EpisodeListRowProps](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/episode-list-row.tsx#41-46).
- Pass `disabled: !isDraggable` to `useSortable`.
- Conditionally render the left drag handle based on `isDraggable`.

### List Components

#### [MODIFY] [grouped-episode-list.tsx](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/grouped-episode-list.tsx)
- Pass `isDraggable={false}` to all [EpisodeCard](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/episode-card.tsx#55-684) and [EpisodeListRow](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/episode-list-row.tsx#47-663) components since grouping is only used for date-based sorts.

#### [MODIFY] [episode-list.tsx](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/episode-list.tsx)
- Pass `isDraggable={sort?.field === 'custom'}` to [EpisodeCard](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/episode-card.tsx#55-684) and [EpisodeListRow](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/components/features/episodes/episode-list-row.tsx#47-663) in the flat list view.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Grid View**:
    1. Select "Manual" sort: Verify top handle is visible and bottom red area allows dragging.
    2. Select "Date Added": Verify top handle is GONE. Verify bottom red area is visible on hover but does NOT allow dragging (no grab cursor).
    3. Repeat for other date filters.
- **List View**:
    1. Select "Manual" sort: Verify left handle is visible and allows dragging.
    2. Select "Date Added": Verify left handle is GONE.
    3. Repeat for other date filters.
- **Mobile**:
    1. Verify behavior on mobile (Grid view is default on mobile).
