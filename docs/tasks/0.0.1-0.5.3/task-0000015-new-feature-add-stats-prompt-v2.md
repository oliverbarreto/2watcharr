# Task: FEATURE: Stats

ok now, lets revise how we can tell the system that i have watched a video or a podccast so it counts "as watched". We have now a filter for "Pending Confirmation" in the "Watch list" but we have no way (at least that i can see) to mark as WATCHED. Also, when we click on a video and we open a new tab with the link to watch it, is the moment that we should mark it as "pending confirmation" lets revise together this feature and how to build it
