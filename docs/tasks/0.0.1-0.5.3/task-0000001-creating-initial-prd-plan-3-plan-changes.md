Modify the plan to consider the two comments made to the plan

Review 2 comments:

-"Summary: Bootstrap a Next.js 14+ application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Set up the foundational project structure following Clean Architecture principles."
USE CURRENT NEXTJS version which is v16

- "Install core dependencies: better-sqlite3 for SQLite database @types/better-sqlite3 for TypeScript support zod for schema validation date-fns for date formatting"
DO NOT USE BETTER-SQLITE3, just use plain sqlite support
