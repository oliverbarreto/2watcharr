# Walkthrough - Chart Legend Relocation

I have successfully moved the chart legend to be positioned directly below the time range selection dropdown menu, as requested.

## Changes Made

### Stats Page
- Modified [page.tsx](file:///Users/oliver/_HD_LOCAL/dev/2watcharr/src/app/stats/page.tsx) to relocate the "Activity Trend" legend.
- Reorganized the `CardHeader` layout to group the `Select` component (time range dropdown) and the `legend` components in a vertical column on the right side.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
The changes were verified by running the development server and inspecting the Stats page.
