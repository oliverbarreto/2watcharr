# TASK: BUGFIX-all-notwatched-pending-watched-filters-not-updating-navbar-icon-ui-prompt-v1

As you can see in the image when we have active one of the filters "all", "not watched", "pending", "watched" the icon in the navbar is for search (magnifying glass) is not updated to reflect the active filter like we do in the rest of the filters.

This is confusing for the user. I can have active the show only pending confirmation of watched videos, with the search and filters floating panel closed, and since the magnifying glass icon is white, I don't know that the list being filtered. 

I want to have the icon updated to reflect the active filter.
