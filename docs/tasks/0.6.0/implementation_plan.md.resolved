# Resolve Git Merge Issue

The user attempted to merge `features/channelstats` into `develop` but ended up with staged changes and no merge commit. Additionally, `features/channelstats` is behind the current `develop` branch (which already includes `features/archive`).

## Proposed Changes

### Git Operations
- Reset the current staged changes to return `develop` to its clean HEAD state.
- Perform a proper `git merge features/channelstats` into `develop`.
- Resolve any merge conflicts that may arise (especially since `develop` has moved ahead).
- Commit the merge.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run test` or `/test` workflow to ensure no regressions.

### Manual Verification
- Check `git status` and `git log` to ensure the history is correct and the state is clean.
