## Overview
We want to modify the channels UX to be more user-friendly. 


## Requirements

1. add a button on the top navigation bar to the left of "channels" to navigate and quickly move to "Watch List"
2. the channel card is extremely basic, we should add more information of the channel to it. Also add the channel thumbnail to the card.
3. When we click on the card it should navigate to the Watch List page and filter the videos to show only the videos from that channel. We should use url search parameters to filter videos on the watch list page.
