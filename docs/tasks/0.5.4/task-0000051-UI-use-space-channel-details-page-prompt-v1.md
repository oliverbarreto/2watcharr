# Task UI: Improve Channel Details page 
- IDE: Antigravity
- Date: 20260217
- Model: Gemini Flash 3.0

## Overview

The channels details page has a section for the description, but it does not take all the space given horizontally. See image.

In mobile screens it fits perfectly, but as soon as the screen size is bigger, as you can see in the image, the text only uses part of the space.


## Requirement 1

Make the text take the whole horizontal space

## Requirement 2

Make the tag pills clickable to allow the user to filter the videos inside that page by tag following the same patter we have in other pages. The user can click more than one tag to filter videos with selected tags. Clicking a tag toggles selected vs not selected.
