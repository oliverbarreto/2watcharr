- IDE: Antigravity
- Date: 20260217
- Model: Gemini Flash 3.0

## Overview

The file `public/2watcharr-icon-v1.png` is a new favicon image that should be used for the application. 

## Requirements

- Replace the current favicon with the new one. 
- Replace the image used in the navbar with the new one.
- In mobile devices, as you can see in the image, we show a humburger button and the image in the top navigation bar. We should maintain the functionality of the humburger icon, but using the new icon image instead. The humberger icon should be removed.
