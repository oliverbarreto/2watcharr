TASK: UI: Improve UI of the stats page. 

As you can see in the image the labels and values are almost overlaping in the "Activity Summary" section.

We want to reduce the horizontal space taken by the "Viewing Time" section. We want to have two columns and two rows for the "Viewing Time" section. This would allow the "Activity Summary" section take some more horitonzal space so we dont have so little space/padding between the labels and the values.
