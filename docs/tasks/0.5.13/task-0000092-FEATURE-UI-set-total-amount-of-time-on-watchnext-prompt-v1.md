# TASK: FEATURE - UI: add total time of episodes in "Watch Next" list
- IDE: Antigravity - Agent Mode
- Date: 2026-02-25
- Model: Gemini 3 Flash

## Overview

We want to add the total amount of time of total number of episodes in the "Watch Next" list (not only visible ones if paginated). 

We already have the number of shown episodes eg: "Showing 26 of 26 prioritized episodes", so we want to add something like "Showing 26 of 26 prioritized episodes" and then, to its right, "Queue time: 2h 30m". 

This total time should not count already watched episodes. It should only count the episodes that are currently in the watch next list.
