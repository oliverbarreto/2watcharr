# TASK: FEATURE - Simplify duplicated code removing duplicated addvideo api call

One important thing to check. I want to check if we are using the other endpoint in our app for anything "POST /api/shortcuts/add-video". 

If not, what i expect, but require your confirmation, we should only use one of these endpoint for the same task, which should be "POST /api/shortcuts/add-episode". 

We should avoid duplicated code
