# Task: Add Pagination to Stats Table

We need to add pagination to the stats table with events on the stats page to control how many rows are displayed at a time and assure optimal performance. 

The table should display 20 rows at a time by default and the user should be able to change the number of rows displayed at a time with a maximun of 200 rows.

There should also have a search text field to allow searching for a specific title. The search should be performed on the title column. The search should be case insensitive and should support partial matches.
