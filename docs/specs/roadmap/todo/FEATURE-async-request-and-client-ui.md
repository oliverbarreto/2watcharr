# Task: Async Request and Client UI

We want to implement async requests and a client ui for the requests. This will allow us to show a loading screen while the request is being processed in the background. 

We need to do it when the user is adding episodes, either a youtube video or a iTunes podcast.

We also need to handle background tasks when the app is adding a channel after the user has added a new video or when we are syncing channel metadata with the button in the channel details card.
