# Task: Infinite Scroll in Watch List Page

## Description

We want to implement infinite scroll in the Watch List page to improve performance when loading a large number of channels. We want also to be pretty much close to the behavior of the watch list page of the YouTube home page.

The page should load a number of episodes and then load more when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page and the loading indicator is visible.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The page should load a number of episodes and then load more when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page and the loading indicator is visible.
- [ ] The infinite scroll should affect both desktop and mobile versions, also in both list view and grid view.
- [ ] A loading indicator should be visible when loading more episodes on the bottom of the page, after the already loaded episodes.
- [ ] The page should display the number of episodes currently being shown and the total number of episodes in the watch list. Place this info in a nice way right after the header that says "Manage your videos and podcasts to watch later"
