# TASK: Add option to mark episode with priority

We need to add an option to mark an episode with priority. This option should be available in the episodes cards in the drop down option menu.

When an episode is marked with priority, it should be displayed with a different color in the watchlist page and in the episode card. 

The priority should be saved in the episode's metadata and should be editable. 

Add this option in the general tab of the settings page.
