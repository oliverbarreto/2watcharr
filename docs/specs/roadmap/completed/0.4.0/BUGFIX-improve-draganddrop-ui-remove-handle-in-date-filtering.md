# Task: Improve Drag and Drop UI

## Description

We want to improve the drag and drop UI to make it more user-friendly and intuitive. We want to remove the handle from the episode cards (grid view) and row cells (list view) in the watch list page for both desktop and mobile versions for all filters except the "manual" filter.

Threfore, for Date Added/Watched/Favorited/Removed case we must:

- in grid view: remove the handle from the top of the episode cards and leave the red area in the bottom that is shown when we hover over the card, but remove the dragging behavior of the red area

- in list view: remove the handle from the left side of the episode cards 

Do not make any other changes to the ui. Just focus on removing the handle and the dragging behavior of the red area for Date Added/Watched/Favorited/Removed filtering options.
