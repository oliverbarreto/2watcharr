- [ ] Add testing infrastructure and start using it in the AI Assistant methodology: 
    - [ ] we should have tests for all the core functionality
    - [ ] use ./src/tests/ to store the tests
    - [ ] the tests should be identified when the implementation plan for a feature is created
    - [ ] the tests should always be run before:
        - The AI assistant should always run the tests and make sure they pass before finalizing the feature
        - creating a new release
        - pushing any changes to the repo
