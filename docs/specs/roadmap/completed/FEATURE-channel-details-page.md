# Task: Channel Details Page

We want to implement a new page to display the details of a youtube channel or podcast channel.

## Requirements

- The page should display the details of a channel with a big banner image of the channel on the top. We should display the information we show in the overlay that is shown when hovering over a channel card but taking advantage of the more space in the page.
    - channel name
    - description
    - the stats of the number of videos we have for that channel.
    - the tags used for its videos
- We should provide the same links:
    - the title should open a new tab to the video on youtube
    - there should be a drop down action button with all the actions we provide in the channel card: delete, sync metadata, and two new actions: mark all as watched, mark all as unwatched
    - the actions should be the same as in the Watch List
- Bellow the channel header and info section, the page should display the episodes of the channel in a list view table, similar to the one we show in the Watch List but only with the episodes of the channel.
