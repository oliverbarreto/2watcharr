# Task: FEATURE - Add pending confirmation metric to stats page

Lets extend the app stats page to show a couple of new metrics:
1. one for episodes not watched.
2. one for episodes pending confirmation of being watched.

Modify the logic, services, model and any other parts of the codebase you consider necessary to support this feature.

Place the stats in the "Activity Summary" section of the stats page, between "Total Watched" and "Total Favorited".
