# Task: Day Week Month Year Chart and Stats Table

## Description:

We need to extend the current functionality that shows the chat in the stats page. 

Currently the chart shows the "Daily Activity: Visualizing your engagement over the last 30 days" and shows data for videos "ADDED" vs "WATCHED".

We need to be able to select using a nice group of radio buttons the time range to display. The options are: Day, Week, Month, Year (This year is the current year), and total (in case of total, we will show the data from all the years taht we have in the database).

Make sure you use Shadcn UI components to display the chart and the table.
