# Task: Deleted Episodes Page

We want to add a deleted episodes page to the app. This page will show all the episodes that have been soft-deleted from the list. They are still saved in the database but are hidden from the main list.

The page will only be accessible from a link in the settings page, in the "General" tab. 

It will navigate to a similar page than the "Watch list" page but with the deleted episodes. 

Create both, a list view and a grid view. The episodes card should now have another option in the dropdown menu, "Remove permanently". This will completely remove the episode from the database.
