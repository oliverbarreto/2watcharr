# Task: Improve UI for adding episodes in mobile

## Description

As you can see in the image, the modal form for adding episodes in mobile is not very user-friendly. It's very polluted with many things and the keyboard overlaps important part of the modal like the buttons. We need to improve the UI.

## Steps

1. add a button to allow the user to paste from clipboard into the textfield
2. We should add a toggle button to show/hide the tags section. In mobile, the tags section should be hidden by default and only appear when the user clicks on a button to add tags. In larger screens, the tags section should be always visible, and the toggle button should be hidden.
