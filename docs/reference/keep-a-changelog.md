# Keep a Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Principles

1.  **Changelogs are for humans**, not machines.
2.  There should be an entry for **every single version**.
3.  The **same types of changes** should be grouped.
4.  Versions and sections should be **linkable**.
5.  The **latest version** comes first.
6.  The **release date** of each version is displayed.
7.  Mention whether you follow **Semantic Versioning**.

## Types of Changes

- `Added`: for new features.
- `Changed`: for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated`: for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed`: for now removed features.
- `Fixed`: for any bug fixes.
- `Security`: in case of vulnerabilities.

## How to update

When a feature or bug fix is completed:

1.  Update the corresponding `docs/specs/roadmap/completed/feature-*.md` or `docs/specs/roadmap/completed/bug-*.md` file, marking tasks as completed. For every file, add date of completion.
2.  Add a concise entry to the `[Unreleased]` section of `CHANGELOG.md` under the appropriate category.
